# DndAndroidCompanionApp
I'm Developing an application in android studio
the intended purpose is a nice n easy way to view all monsters in dnd, and see there stats, roll health, and possible attacks.

Put the DndApp folder where your android studio projects are located
I tested the app on the emulated nexus 5

version .4 
has a List of all monsters that can be searched
can search that list through a more detailed view

Known bug:
Removing a search seems to not return the list back to normal
